# getThroughAList
This algorithm goes through a list returning all combination of values of a numeric array from (0,0,0) to (x,y,z). Size of the array must be at least 2 to N and numeric values contained on it can be also from 0, to M.

To use correctly you have to change package name (Default: anonimizacion) to your package on the first line of each .java file. Also you can create a anonimizacion package in order to not change all files.

In the Main.java file you can find the first Array ([1,2,3]) and then the caller to Combination.combinationUtil(Array). In the Class Combination you can find all necessary functions to get through your list.
